# template

This is a template repositroy following The Blugold Group's design standards.

The club's lingua franca in **Python**. It's useful in almost all fields of cybersecurity (and CS (and any interdisciplinary field which uses CS)), it's easy to learn, easy to understand, and we teach it to all of our members. All projects should be written in Python if possible, another language if necessary

All projects should have a README.ms file which provides a comprehensive explanation of the program, its goals, and the status of reaching those goals. There should also be easy to undertsand and use installation instructions. All projects must support Linux (kali) if applicable, and other platforms if possible

All projects must have a DEVELOPMENT.md file which explains the engineering concepts and archetecture in detail, allowing for new programmers to more easily undertsand how the project works and how to contribute
